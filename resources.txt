							plan/product, plan/name, plan/version, and plan/promotionCode.

							For example, to filter by a resource type, use: $filter=resourceType eq 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks'

							You can use substringof(value, property) in the filter. The properties you can use for substring are: name and resourceGroup.
